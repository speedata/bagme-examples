<h1>The frog king</h1>

<p>In olden times when wishing still <em>helped</em> one,
   there lived a king whose daughters were all beautiful,
   but the <span class="green">youngest</span> was so beautiful that the sun itself,
   which has seen so much, was
   <span style="font-weight: bold">astonished</span> whenever it
   shone in her face.</p>

<p class="indent">Close by the king's castle lay a great dark forest,
	and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well,
	and when the day was very warm, the king's child
	went out into the forest and sat down by the side of
	the cool <span id="important">fountain</span>, and when she was bored she took a
	golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it,
	and this ball was her favorite plaything.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Now it so happened that on one occasion the princess's golden ball did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it,</li>
	<li>but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>The king's daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen.</li>
	<li> At this she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be comforted.</li>
</ol>
